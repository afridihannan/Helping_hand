# Helping_hand
## This Project is built in a hackathon organised by Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology.

Developing is not an easy task and as a developer we love to automate our work flow and be as lazy as we can. Keeping an eye over some of the modern problems and requirements, In this hackathon we the Team of 3 passionate developers have come up with a solution to build a set of chrome extension under one extension that can help them in the following manner.The set includes:
<ol>
 <li>Grid system</li>
<li>Drag and drop system</li>
<li>.Sketch Board System</li>
<li>Alan Voice Assisstant</li>
<li>To-do list.</li>
</ol>

So We have wrapped all the features and functionalities inside a single chrome extension, <b>The Helping Hand</b>.
## The functionalities of the features includes:
### <u>Grid System</u>:
It is often observed that while placing the elements(or div) in a developing page, we face the problem of comparing the symmetry or gaps on both sides or even alignment of a particular element. So we have the designed a grid functionality where user can have their ```<i>own defined grid margins</i>``` (just like a user-defined graph sheet) Which would be the best according to his needs for aligning the objects accordingly.
       ```<i>Tech Stack</i>``` -CSS,JavaScript.
### <u>Drag and drop system</u>:
This feature is basically designed in such a way that the developer can drag his div itself from the browser over the screen and adjust its alignment as per required without changing his original code.
This is most beneficial during the UI changes where we can arrange the item to try out and observe different layers.
```<i>Tech Stack/Library</i>```-jQuery
### <u>Sketch Board System</u>:
 We have many things that we want to point out in browser. just as an example- A teacher pointing to some lines in the documentation from the browser. So the ```<i>Sketcher</i>``` can be helped in pointing out over the browser itself.
 ```<i>Tech Stack/Library</i>```-p5.js
### <u>Alan Voice Assisstant</u>:
We can set up an Alan Voice assisstant using Alan AI throught the content scripts over the browser extensions
```<i>Tech Framework/Library</i>```-Alan AI
### <u>Todo List</u>:
A todo list for reminder where we can put our thoughts or our todos.
```<i>Tech Stack</i>``` -CSS,JavaScript,HTML.
