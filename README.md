# Helping_hand
## This Project is built in a hackathon organised by Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology.

Developing is not an easy task and as a developer we love to automate our work flow and be as lazy as we can. Keeping an eye over some of the modern problems and requirements, In this hackathon we the Team of 3 passionate developers have come up with a solution to build a set of chrome extension under one extension that can help them in the following manner.The set includes:
1.Grid system
2.Drag and drop system
3.Sketch System
4.Alan (the speaking system)
5.To-do list.

So We have wrapped all the features and functionalities inside a single chrome extension, <b>The Helping Hand</b>.
